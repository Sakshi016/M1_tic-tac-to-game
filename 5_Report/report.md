##Games provide a real source of enjoyment in daily life. Games also are helpful in improving the physical and mental health of human. Apart from daily life physical games, people also play computer games. These games are different than those of physical games in a sense that they do not involve much physical activity rather mental and emotional activities. Getting games to react back to the user of a game has always been long hard question for game programmers. Because, lets just face it, a good game that doesn’t challenge the user’s ability to play the game doesn’t keep the user around very long. This idea can be applied to any form of game that is out there. Board games are never fun when the opponent that he or she is playing doesn’t learn or catches on. With today’s computers always advancing, programmers are always looking for new ways to make a video game more interesting and challenging for the user.
Tic-Tac-Toe game [1] can be played by two players where the square block (3 x 3) can be filled with a cross (X) or a circle (O). The game will toggle between the players by giving the chance for each player to mark their move. When one of the players make a combination of 3 same markers in a horizontal, vertical or diagonal line the program will display which player has won, whether X or O.
The Tic-Tac-Toe game is most familiar among all the age groups. The friendliness of Tic-tac-toe games makes them ideal as a pedagogical tool for teaching the concepts of good sportsmanship. The game is a very good brain exercise. It involves looking ahead and trying to figure out what the person playing against you might do next.
